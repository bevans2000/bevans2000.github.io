# Building Template - TOPAZ-2A Reactor

## Description
The TOPAZ-2A Reactor is a minor improvement of the TOPAZ-II reactor system, which was developed by Soviet Union in 1987 for use by Cosmos 1818 and Cosmos 1867 satellites in space. Based on thermionic energy conversion with highly enriched uranium oxide pellet as fuel, it was cooled by liquid-metal consisting of sodium and potassium. It has 37 single-cell TFEs, with a much improved 10.5% thermal-to-electrical conversion efficiency and 83.3% load capacity to provide 10.03 kWe.
