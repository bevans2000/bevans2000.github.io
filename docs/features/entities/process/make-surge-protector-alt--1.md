# Manufacturing Process - Make Surge Protector Alt #1

## Description
 A surge protector protects electrical devices in alternating current (AC) circuits from &#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;voltage spikes, which can arise from a variety of causes including lightning strikes in the &#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;vicinity and have a very short duration measured in microseconds. It limits the voltage supplied &#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;to electrical devices to a certain threshold, by short-circuiting current to ground or absorbing &#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;the spike when a transient occurs, thus avoiding damage to the appliances and devices connected &#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;to it.&#10;&#9;&#9;
