# Resource - Thermoplastic Elastomer

## Description
&#10;&#9;&#9;Thermoplastic elastomers (TPE), sometimes referred to as thermoplastic rubbers, are a &#10;&#9;&#9;class of copolymers or a physical mix of polymers (usually a plastic and a rubber) &#10;&#9;&#9;that consist of materials with both thermoplastic and elastomeric properties.&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;The benefit of using thermoplastic elastomers is the ability to stretch to moderate &#10;&#9;&#9;elongations and return to its near original shape creating a longer life and better &#10;&#9;&#9;physical range than other materials.&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;TPE film is added to the liquid cooling garment to allow for water vapor or &#10;&#9;&#9;perspiration to travel out, away from the skin. The film is a monoflim membrance with &#10;&#9;&#9;superior permeability, water-vapor transmittion, and tear strength properties. It would&#10;&#9;&#9;not allow water to penetrate in the opposite direction back to the skin. It is a one-way&#10;&#9;&#9;water-vapor transport wicking material that maintain a comfortable microclimate between &#10;&#9;&#9;the fabric&#39;s surfaces closet to the skin.&#10;&#9;
