# Resource - Acetylene

## Description
&#10;&#9;&#9;Acetylene is a colorless gas that has a strong garlic-like odor. When &#10;&#9;&#9;combined with oxygen, it becomes very hot and is classified as the &#10;&#9;&#9;hottest fuel gas. &#10;&#9; &#9;It is also the only fuel gas that can weld and cut steel, making it &#10;&#9; &#9;the preferred choice for welders. The welding process that uses &#10;&#9; &#9;acetylene is known as oxy-fuel cutting or gas cutting. &#10;&#9; &#9;Acetylene is probably the hottest burning fuel gas available to us. &#10;&#9; &#9;Acetylene releases almost 40% of its heat in the inner flame cone. &#10;&#9; &#9;Acetylene is also commonly used for the production of other chemicals used &#10;&#9; &#9;in perfumes, vitamins, polymers, solvents and other materials due to its &#10;&#9; &#9;versatility and ease of reactive control in comparison to other gases. &#10;&#9; &#9;It combines nicely with a variety of elements and compounds, making it &#10;&#9; &#9;the most important of starting materials for &#10;&#9; &#9;organic synthesis.
