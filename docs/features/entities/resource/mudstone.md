## Description
&#10;  &#9; A rock succession on the lower slopes of Mount Sharp that comprises thinly laminated mudstones. &#10;  &#9; These rock outcrops are very fine-grained sedimentary rocks that we interpret as having formed &#10;  &#9; from particles suspended in water, which slowly settled. &#10;&#9;
