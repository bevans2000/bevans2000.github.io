# Resource - Granite

## Description
The granitoid rocks on Mars may have formed when thick&#10;&#9; sequences of basaltic rocks were metamorphosed by moderate heat and pressure and then&#10;&#9; partially melted. Observed the craters&#39; central peaks, they must have been dredged up from&#10;&#9; depths by the force of the crater-making impact. http://themis.asu.edu/node/5395.
