# Resource - Calcium sulfate

## Description
&#10;&#9;&#9;CaSO4 has a molecular weight of 136.14 g/mol. Derived from limestone, it &#10;&#9;&#9;occurs naturally in the form of gypsum, and may be used as a sequestrant &#10;&#9;&#9;in food as well as a buffer and firming agent. Artificial sweetener base, &#10;&#9;&#9;bleaching agent for bread rolls, flour, tinned tomatoes, soy tofu, &#10;&#9;&#9;dried egg, cheese products, tooth paste. Used in mortar, &#10;&#9;&#9;cement and plaster of Paris. Calcium sulfate has a long history of use &#10;&#9;&#9;in medicine and dentistry, including bone regeneration as a graft material &#10;&#9;&#9;and graft binder/extender, and as a barrier in guided tissue regeneration.&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;Crystalline phases of CaSO4 &#10;&#9;&#9;(1). Anhydrite. CaSO4.&#10;&#9;&#9;(2). Dihydrate. CaSO4·2H2O. Called gypsum, as a bleaching agent for crude&#10;&#9;&#9;     soya bean vegetable oil&#10;&#9; &#9;(3). Hemihydrate. CaSO4.1⁄2H2O). bassanite. Also called plaster of Paris.&#10;&#9; &#9;&#10;&#9; &#9;Calcium sulfate, 516 or E516, a common laboratory and industrial chemical. &#10;&#9; &#9;Also used as a coagulant in products like tofu.&#10;&#9; &#9;&#10;&#9; &#9;CaSO4 is used as a coating agent for papers and adds thickness and &#10;&#9; &#9;durability, making the paper harder to rip. &#10;&#10;&#9; &#9;Specifically, it&#39;s used in cooking as a &#10;&#9;&#9;a. Firming agent - Helps maintain firmness of fruits and vegetables or interacts with &#10;&#9;&#9;   gelling agents to strengthen food structure. &#10;&#9;&#9;b. Flour treatment agent - A substance that improves baking quality or colour of flour. &#10;&#9;&#9;c. Sequestrant - A substance which controls the availability of a cation. &#10;&#9;&#9;d. Stabiliser - A substance that maintains the uniform dispersal of substances in a food. &#10;&#9;
