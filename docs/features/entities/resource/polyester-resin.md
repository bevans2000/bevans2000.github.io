# Resource - Polyester resin

## Description
&#10;&#9;&#9;Polyester resins are thermoplastic polymers. It&#39;s the most widely used resin systems in the marine industry. &#10;&#9; By far the majority of dinghies, yachts and workboats built in composites make use of this &#10;&#9; resin system. Polyesters are produced commercially both as saturated and unsaturated resins. &#10;&#9; The most common, highest volume produced polyester is Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a &#10;&#9; saturated polyester that finds utilization in such applications as fibers for clothing and &#10;&#9; carpet, food and liquid containers (such as a water/soda bottles), as well as films. &#10;&#9; PETâ€™s non-reactance with many foods makes it an ideal packaging material. Because &#10;&#9; of its easy application and durability, polyester resin is also applied to patch cracks &#10;&#9; and holes that need to remain watertight.
