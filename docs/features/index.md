## TERRAFORMING

Altering global climate, large scale geo-engineering, permanently transforming human surface activities.  

Currently, mars-sim focuses primarily in offering a simulation engine showcasing human activities in the aforementioned phase 1 and some phase 2 and a little bit of phase 3. Below are the five core features of mars-sim:
